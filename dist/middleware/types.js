/**
 * Unified Middleware Type System
 *
 * This module provides a sophisticated type-safe middleware system that supports
 * both synchronous and asynchronous middleware with full context tracking.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Type-level context tracking through middleware chains
 * - Compile-time validation of middleware compatibility
 * - Support for both sync and async execution
 * - Recursive type inference for composed middleware
