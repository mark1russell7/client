The packages accept `@mark1russell7/service` 0.5.1 and later 0.5 versions, and `@procedures/client` accepts `@mark1russell7/algebra` 0.7.1. Before, the range `^0.4.1` stopped below 0.5. An application on service 0.5 then got a second copy of service inside the client.

- The client uses only the `/backoff`, `/heartbeat` and `/testing` entries of service. The code of `/backoff`, `/heartbeat` and the clock is the same in 0.4.1 and 0.5.1. `/testing` only gets new exports.
- The public API of the client does not change.
