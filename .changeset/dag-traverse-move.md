`dag.traverse` moved from `@procedures/lib` to `@procedures/dag`. Its name, input, output and effects stay the same. In this version, `@procedures/dag` has a `./module` entry, a `./register` entry and the `client.procedures` field, and it depends on `@procedures/client` and `zod`. The graph algorithms of its root do not change.

`dag.traverse` gets the packages from `lib.scan` through `ctx.client` (`calls: ["lib.scan"]`). `@procedures/lib` depends on `@procedures/dag`, so the module of `@procedures/dag` does not list the module of `@procedures/lib` as a dependency: a host registers the two modules. `bundle-dev`, `bundle-mcp` and `mark` do. The module of `@procedures/lib` does not register `dag.traverse` any more.

`DagTraverseInputSchema`, `DagTraverseInput`, `DagTraverseOutput` and `TraverseNodeResult` are exports of `@procedures/dag`, not of `@procedures/lib`.
