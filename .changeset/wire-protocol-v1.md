Wire protocol v1 (roadmap R25). `WIRE-PROTOCOL.md` specifies the HTTP and WebSocket formats. A WebSocket connection starts with a `hello` frame of each side (`getServerProtocol()` on the client), and HTTP sends the header `Procedures-Protocol: 1` on each request and response. A side refuses a newer version with `PROTOCOL_VERSION`. `ERROR_CODES` is the one list of error codes and HTTP statuses of all faces. The reason of a `FORBIDDEN` error travels on each face: in the HTTP error body, in the item metadata of the HTTP and local transports, and in the `_meta` of an MCP error result. `Method.version` is deprecated: the server ignores it. Golden tests in `packages/client/test/wire/` pin the frames.
