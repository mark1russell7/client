The check before the run in the hosts (roadmap R22). `programCheckInterceptor()` of `@procedures/compiler` checks the program of each call to a data-driven procedure before the first step. When the check finds an error, no step starts, so a refusal in step 3 comes before the write of step 1. The MCP server of `@procedures/mcp-dev-tools` uses it (`MCP_PROGRAM_CHECK=false` turns it off). `bundle-mcp` and `bundle-dev` have the compiler module, so Claude gets the tools `program.check` and `program.compile` (65 tools), and `mark program check` works.
