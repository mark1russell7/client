The bidirectional peer (roadmap R24). The calls over one WebSocket go in the two directions with the same frames: a request, then a response, an error or a stream with credit, and a cancel. The client serves the calls of the server with the new `serve` option of `WebSocketTransport` (for example a `ProcedureServer` with its registry), so a call gets validation, the expose rule, the capability, streaming, cancel, the signal and the deadline. The server sends them with `callConnection()`, or with a `Client` over `transportFor(connectionId)`, and a peer has `connections()` and `clientFor(connectionId)`. `callClient()` and `onServerRequest` stay as wrappers of the new calls, and the old `server-request` frames are no longer sent. The shared code of the two sides (`OutgoingCalls`, `IncomingCalls`) serves the calls of the client too.
