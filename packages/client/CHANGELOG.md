# @mark1russell7/client

## 0.1.0

The first release on npm. The packages of the client monorepo have one version together.

### Breaking changes (from the versions on GitHub)

- `procedure.get` gives `{ found: false }` for a path that has no procedure. Before, it gave `null`. For a procedure, it gives `found: true` with the description.
- `procedure.list` lists the registry of the caller. It takes `namespace` and `includeMetadata`, and it marks the procedures of `procedure.define` with `runtime: true`.
