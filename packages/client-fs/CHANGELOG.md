### Patch Changes

- b5db4d8: Under the root of the files of a host, the `git.*` procedures are confined, not refused (roadmap R33, tracker item O35). Without a root, nothing changes. PATCH: a procedure that the root refused now works in the root.
  
  - The core: `ProcedureContext.fsRoot` is the root of a confined call. `confineToRoot()` of `@procedures/fs` gives it to the handler of each confined procedure and of each program procedure.
  - The working folder `cwd` of each `git.*` procedure must be in the root, and its default is the root. The pathspecs, the `path` of `git.blame` and of the worktree procedures, and the `dest` of `git.clone` must be in the root too.
  - Under a root, git runs with `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` at the parent of the root, so it finds no repository above the root. The configuration of the system does not apply. The global configuration has only `user.name`, `user.email` and `init.defaultBranch` of the host.
  - The `-c` options turn off the hooks (an empty `core.hooksPath`) and `core.fsmonitor`. Only the transports https, http, ssh and git are permitted. Git does not go into a submodule.
  - Before the first command in a folder, git examines the repository. A repository outside the root (through a `.git` file or an alternate object folder), a repository with submodules, and a configuration key that starts a program are refused: `filter.*`, `diff.external`, `core.sshCommand`, `credential.helper`, `include.path` and the others. The error names each key.
  - `git.clone` and `git.remote.set` refuse a URL with `::` under a root.
  - `@procedures/git` now depends on `@procedures/fs` (for the rules of `@procedures/fs/root`).

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 90ea741: `confineToRoot(registry, root)` confines each procedure of a registry to a root (roadmap R33). The `fs.*` procedures get the handlers of `createFsModule({ root })`. Each other procedure gets the decision of `rootDecisionOf()`: the root examines the path inputs of its `metadata.fsRoot`, or it refuses the procedure with `FORBIDDEN` and the reason `outside-root`. A procedure without rules is refused when its effects are not known, name `fs`, or write `process`.
  
  The new entry `@procedures/fs/root` has the rules of the root without the procedures. `inRoot()` takes an optional base folder, and `resolveRoot()` an optional name for its error. `confineFsProcedures()` does not change.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a47bee6: The hosts can confine the file procedures to a root (roadmap R33).
  
  - `confineFsProcedures(registry, root)` of `@procedures/fs` replaces the handler of each `fs.*` procedure of a registry with the handler of `createFsModule({ root })`. It adds no procedure. A nested `fs.*` call of another procedure is confined too. The root must be a folder that exists.
  - `mark --fs-root <folder>` confines the `fs.*` procedures of each mode and host of `mark`: a command, the REPL, `--server`, `serve` and `mcp`. Give the flag before the command.
  - A `mark` command uses a CLI server only when the server has the same root. The lockfile of `@procedures/peer` has the new field `fsRoot`, and `findServer()` compares it.
  - `procedure-server --fs-root <folder>` and `mark serve --fs-root <folder>` confine the procedures of the server.
  - The MCP server reads `MCP_FS_ROOT`, and `mark mcp` has the flag `--fs-root`. `fs` is not a tool namespace, so the tools do not change.
  - A path outside the root gives `FORBIDDEN` with the reason `outside-root`. A procedure that reads files with `node:fs`, or that starts a program, is not confined.
  - `@procedures/lib/cli-flags` has the global flags `--fs-root` and `--events`, and the field `repeatable`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d76cb7: `fs.copy` refuses an existing destination without `overwrite`: the error has the code `EEXIST`, and the copy changes nothing. This applies to a file and to a folder, with `recursive` true or false. Before, the default copy (`recursive: true`) kept an existing file, merged a folder into an existing folder, and reported success. With `overwrite`, the copy replaces the files at the destination, as before.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f23c7ad: Four file procedures (roadmap R44). `fs.write.json` writes a value as JSON through a file that it renames at the end. `fs.hash` gives the hash of a file. `fs.temp` makes a temporary folder. `fs.watch` gives the changes of a file or folder as a stream without an end. With `createFsModule({ root })`, each path stays in the root, and `fs.temp` makes its folders in the folder `.tmp` of the root.
- bc70357: The file procedures can have a root (roadmap R33). `createFsModule({ root })` gives the procedures of `fsModule`, and each path of each input must be in the root folder. A relative path starts at the root. Without a root, the procedures operate as before.
  
  The procedures refuse a path that goes up with `..`, an absolute path outside the root and another drive. They also refuse a symlink or a junction that goes out of the root. The error has the code `FORBIDDEN` and the new reason `outside-root` (the type `ForbiddenReason` of `@procedures/client`). For a path that does not exist, the check uses the real path of the nearest existing folder. `registerFsProcedures(registry, { root })` takes the root too.

### Patch Changes

- 3c40d2d: The root of the file procedures accepts a path by its real path. On Windows, a folder can have a short 8.3 name (`RUNNER~1`) and a long real name. A path that used the short name was refused when the root was a link.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 76d0d64: **Breaking:** an import of a package registers nothing. The `./register` entry of a package registers its procedures, and the procedures of the modules that they need, in the global registry (ARCHITECTURE-PROPOSALS-2026-10, P9).
  
  - `import "@procedures/git"` gives the exports and registers nothing. Use `import "@procedures/git/register"`, or give `gitModule` (`@procedures/git/module`) to `createRegistry()`.
  - `import "@procedures/client/register"` registers the control flow (`client.chain` and the others) and `procedure.define`/`get`/`list`/`delete`. `createRegistry()` adds them to each new registry, as before. The new `registerClientProcedures(registry?)` does the same for any registry.
  - Each `register<Name>Procedures(registry?)` function is in the module of its package, takes a registry (the global one by default) and registers the modules that the package requires. `registerBridge` (splay) and `register` (store) are now `registerSplayProcedures` and `registerStoreProcedures`. The old names stay for one version.
  - `sideEffects` names only `./dist/register.js`, so a bundler can drop the rest of a package.
  - The bundles require `clientModule`, so `@procedures/bundle-mcp/register` gives the whole tool surface.
  - `lib new` makes `src/module.ts` and a root without side effects, and `procedure new` adds procedures to the module.
